# wordle-solver-OA
An OA I did for a robotics company. Focuses on OOP in C++ and algorithms. 
I liked how I solved the questions so thought I uploaded my solution + documentation.

# Components:
Wordle Class -> contains logic for wordle game
SolveWordle -> to be implemented, should return answer to an instance of a Wordle Game
            -> minimize number of guesses

# Things to consider:
Algorithm should solve game in a reasonable amount of attempts (but not restricted to 5 like the real game)
Text file will include a list of words of arbitrary lenght, must filter through to get words of length 5
OA has strong emphasis on testing too. So testing harnesses should be rigorous

That's all!
